The step of extracting meaning from these datasets has, however, been limited by the ability to analyze these results and compare them with quantitative phenotypes. We demonstrate the application of a new model for Resilient Distributed Datasets present in Spark enable quantitative analysis and real-time exploration of hundreds of phenotypes with millions of samples. \r\n\r\n### Links\r\n- [The slides from this presentation](https://rawgithub.com/4Quant/machine-learning-meetup/master/zurichMLPresentation.html)\r\n- [4Quant](http://www.4quant.com)\r\n- [Introduction to Apache Spark](http://4quant.github.io/spark-introduction)\r\n- [Quantitative Big Imaging Course](http://kmader.github.io/Quantitative-Big-Imaging-Course)\r\n\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https://rawgithub.com/4Quant/machine-learning-meetup/master/zurichMLPresentation.html\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" style=\"display:block; margin: 0 auto;\">&nbsp;</iframe>\r\n","google":"UA-48764461-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
